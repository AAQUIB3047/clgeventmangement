College Event Management System - Execution Details

Project Overview:
This is a full-stack college event management system with:
- Django backend (REST API for user management, events, registrations, attendance)
- Spring Boot microservice (for admin operations, dashboard data)
- React frontend (user interface)
- MongoDB database (via djongo for Django, native for Spring Boot)

Prerequisites:
1. Install MongoDB Community Edition
   - Download from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
   - Follow installation instructions for your OS
   - Start MongoDB service

2. Install Java 17 or higher
   - Download from https://adoptium.net/

3. Install Node.js 16 or higher
   - Download from https://nodejs.org/

4. Install Python 3.8 or higher
   - Download from https://python.org/

Execution Commands:

1. Start MongoDB:
   mongod

2. Setup Django Backend:
   cd college_event_management/backend
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver 8000

3. Setup Spring Boot Backend:
   cd college_event_management/spring_backend
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run

4. Setup React Frontend:
   cd college_event_management/frontend
   npm install
   npm start

Services will run on:
- Django API: http://localhost:8000
- Spring Boot Admin Service: http://localhost:8080
- React Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Important Notes:
- Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the backends
- The system uses JWT authentication
- Admin panel operations are handled by Spring Boot microservice
- CORS is configured for frontend-backend communication
- Database: college_event_management (MongoDB)

Testing:
- Create admin user: python add_user.py (in backend directory)
- Access admin panel at http://localhost:3000/admin
- Test login and event management features

Deployment:
- For production, update settings.py with production database URL
- Configure environment variables for secrets
- Use reverse proxy (nginx) for serving static files
- Containerize with Docker for easy deployment
